# Contacts with realtime chat
## Luis Quijada

**19Hours commit:** 
*In this commit (19hours since I stared the evaluation), the app is working property, Login, Register, Forgot Password (All about Authentication) is finished.*

*Due a family emergency right now I won't be able to continue developing the app (5 hours remaining), but as you can see, the app is working, with the features, icons, layouts, storyboard*

I understood what you requested me to develop, a chat application, the requirements list was a little bit poor, in the sense that we can interpret in differents ways, but I done what you request.

> I hope you check the code and like it too.
> Best regards.
